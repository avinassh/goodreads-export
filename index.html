<p>M&amp;S is a fully funded, new startup in the block. Started by bunch of <a href="https://github.com/avinassh/rockstar">Rockstar</a> coders who are travellers, sapiosexuals and philosophers. One of our co-founder deleted the lawyer, hit the Facebook and gymmed up. After deleting his quora, he spent 6 months in himalayas. Once enlightened, he came back with the wisdom and this is the result. </p>

<li>Provide us your email ID and link to your Goodreads account. </li>
<li>Once it is passed through our revolutionary algorithm(patent pending), we will send bunch of files, each corresponding to your Goodreads book shelf. For example, if you have three shelves, like <code>read</code>, <code>reading</code>, <code>naughty</code> then you will receive 3 corresponding files i.e. <code>reading.csv</code>, <code>reading.csv</code> and <code>naughty.csv</code>
</li>
<li>Then go to Libib.com, create a new library for each book shelf</li>
<li>Go to <a href="https://www.libib.com/library/add-items">Add items</a>, select <code>CSV Import</code> and upload the CSV file for each library</li>
<li>???</li>

<blockquote>
<p>I was getting married and was about to tie the final knot. And then I heard about M&amp;S from the bride. I made her refer me to M&amp;S and I walked out of the marriage. This is the best decision I ever made!</p>

<p>M&amp;S is just besht. These guys are professionals and they know what they are doing. Just get someone to refer you and you are set for life. In span of 6 minutes, all my data from Goodreads was moved to Libib. If this is not revolutionary, then what is?</p>
