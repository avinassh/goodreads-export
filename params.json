{"name":"Movers and Shakers","tagline":"","body":"# Movers and Shakers\r\n\r\nM&S is a fully funded, new startup in the block. Started by bunch of [Rockstar](https://github.com/avinassh/rockstar) coders who are travellers, sapiosexuals and philosophers. One of our co-founder deleted the lawyer, hit the Facebook and gymmed up. After deleting his quora, he spent 6 months in himalayas. Once enlightened, he came back with the wisdom and this is the result. \r\n\r\n## What we do\r\n\r\nWe are an amazing, revolutionary data science startup. We deal with tera bytes of data every hour. Our main service is, we help moving your Goodreads library to Libib. Libib is a revolutionary startup, just like M&S. And it will change your life and the way you think about books.\r\n\r\n## How to\r\n\r\nM&S is currently in pre-alpha stage. And our services are not available to general public. To obtain our services, you should meet at least one of the following criteria:\r\n\r\n- You are George R R Martin\r\n- You are killed by George R R Martin in ASIOF series\r\n- You are followed by George R R Martin on Twitter\r\n- You have won Nobel prize in Literature\r\n- You are an alien (Extra Terrestrial)\r\n\r\nIf you don't meet any criteria, then you will have to wait till the public launch. Or If you know anyone who has used our services, get them to refer you. That'll do ;)\r\n\r\n## Process\r\n\r\n1. Provide us your email ID and link to your Goodreads account. \r\n2. Once it is passed through our revolutionary algorithm(patent pending), we will send bunch of files, each corresponding to your Goodreads book shelf. For example, if you have three shelves, like `read`, `reading`, `naughty` then you will receive 3 corresponding files i.e. `reading.csv`, `reading.csv` and `naughty.csv`\r\n3. Then go to Libib.com, create a new library for each book shelf\r\n4. Go to [Add items](https://www.libib.com/library/add-items), select `CSV Import` and upload the CSV file for each library\r\n5. ???\r\n6. Profit\r\n\r\n## Testimonials\r\n\r\n> I was getting married and was about to tie the final knot. And then I heard about M&S from the bride. I made her refer me to M&S and I walked out of the marriage. This is the best decision I ever made!\r\n\r\n\\- Amit\r\n\r\n> M&S is just besht. These guys are professionals and they know what they are doing. Just get someone to refer you and you are set for life. In span of 6 minutes, all my data from Goodreads was moved to Libib. If this is not revolutionary, then what is?\r\n\r\n\\- doc_two_thirty\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
